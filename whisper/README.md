Data:
there are 2 data files:

users.csv -> has the userid, device they use, time that they started using whisper
	  -> FORMAT: user_id, device_type & app_version, ts_created

events.csv -> a log of events that the app generated for different cohorts
	   -> FORMAT: test cohort of the event, event name, user_id, whisper_id, extra information, time when the event was generated
	   -> the extra field contains "reply" when the whisper was in reply to another whisper and "top-level" when it's a top level post.


Please include analysis, code and conclusion in a pdf report.
